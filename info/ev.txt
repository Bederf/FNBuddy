# Electric Vehicle Charging Guidelines

To ensure fairness and efficiency for all users, please follow these etiquette guidelines when using electric vehicle chargers:

## Be Mindful of Others
- Avoid occupying a charging spot longer than necessary once your vehicle is charged.
- Move your vehicle promptly to allow others to use the charger.

## Respect Reserved Spots
- If certain spots are designated for electric vehicle charging only, respect those designations even if other spots are available.

## Follow Charging Etiquette
- If multiple chargers are available and your vehicle is already charged, consider moving to another charger if others are waiting.

## Park Properly
- Park within designated lines and ensure your vehicle's charging port is easily accessible to others.

## Don't Block Access
- Avoid parking in front of chargers or blocking access to chargers when not actively charging.

## Leave Chargers Ready
- When done charging, ensure the charger is left in a usable condition for the next user (e.g., return cables to their hooks).

## Communicate Delays
- If you anticipate your vehicle will be charging longer than usual, consider leaving a note or using an app to notify others of the expected delay.

## Be Courteous
- Treat fellow EV drivers with respect and courtesy, fostering a positive community around electric vehicle usage.

By following these etiquette guidelines, you contribute to a smoother experience for all electric vehicle users and help promote the adoption of sustainable transportation practices.
