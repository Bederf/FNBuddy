# Scope
- This policy is applicable to all permanent and permanent part-time employees of the bank.
- Re-engaged pensioners will qualify for leave accrual which is applicable to their new band.

# Eligibility
- All leave becomes a right on accrual and may be taken at any time at the convenience of the bank.
- Leave will be calculated according to your contracted working week.

# Leave Accrual
- As from 6 November 2023, statutory leave which equates to 3 working weeks will be allocated upfront annually in the employee’s anniversary month of joining or re-joining the bank and will be pro-rated if the employee does not begin on the 1st of the month.
- Although statutory leave is allocated upfront annually in your anniversary month, in principle it is meant to accrue monthly. If the employee terminates employment with the group before the leave days accrue, the employee must refund the gross amounts of any leave taken in advance.
- Contractual leave will accrue monthly in arrears from the month of joining and will be pro-rated if the employee does not begin on the 1st of the month.
- On 30 June each year, outstanding leave in excess of the maximum accrual will be automatically commuted for cash and paid in July. Employees seconded outside of South Africa are exempt.
- Employees may accrue annual leave to the following maximum values:
  - 6-day work week: 72 days
  - 5-day work week: 60 days
  - 4-day work week: 48 days
  - 3-day work week: 36 days
  - 2-day work week: 24 days

If you have previously used the interim leave application form please remember to re-capture any leave on Workday.  In addition remember that all future dated leave that was applied for on Oracle will also need to be recaptured on Workday.  All leave must be captured by close of business 9 November. 

 

Note:  Failure to capture your leave on Workday may result in disciplinary action. Please visit MEatWork (sharepoint.com) where quick reference guides are available on how to log into Workday and how to capture leave.

As an employee you are responsible for:

 

Discussing all leave requirements with your line manager as certain absences are auto-approved or auto-declined.
Ensure that the rule for annual leave is adhered to, namely that you take three weeks of annual leave in every anniversary cycle, of which two weeks must be consecutive.
As an employee, you are fully responsible for complying with the rules.​​​​​​​​​




In order to improve both user experience and line manager efficiency, certain leave types have been identified to either auto-approve or auto-decline after seven days.
