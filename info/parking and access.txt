## Disabled Parking
- Disabled parking requires authorization by Wellness before allocation of permanent parking where the disabled employee is situated.

## Motorcycle Parking
- Motorcycle parking does not receive clearance on access cards. Staff members must show their access card at the boom, and security will open it.
- Helpdesk logs a call on MyQ with the staff memberâ€™s details and motorbike details to provide a sticker on the access card, similar to a laptop card.
- Motorcycle parking is in designated motorcycle parking in the basement, not in a regular parking bay.

## Access Cards
- All permanent residents (staff or subcontractors) who enter FNB premises must have an access card.
- To obtain an access card, apply through [SailPoint IdentityIQ - Manage User Access](https://fnb.co.za).
  - The application must be approved by an authorized person from your department.
  - Collect the access card within 3 working days, or the application will be automatically rejected.
- Access cards, laptop cards, and replacement cards can be collected at the Access Card Office or Receptions.

## Laptop Access
- If bringing a laptop regularly, apply for a clearance card via [SailPoint IdentityIQ - Manage User Access](https://fnb.co.za).
- For ad hoc laptop use, complete the asset removal form, authorized by a qualified staff member.

## Firearms and Security
- Firearms are not allowed in the building. They must be locked away in lockers provided at the main entrance.

## After-Hours Access
- For after-hours access, special arrangements can be made by contacting Security in advance if your access card is not activated for 24-hour access.

## Deliveries
- All goods delivered to campus must go through the goods receiving facilities.
- No deliveries or collection at the reception desk. You will be contacted by goods receiving staff to collect goods after a security check.
- Goods must be collected promptly as the facility does not offer storage and is not responsible for lost or damaged goods.
